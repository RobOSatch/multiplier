# [ multiplier ]
Check out the game on itch.io! -> [PLAY](https://robertbarta.itch.io/multiply)
This game was created during the GMTK2020-GameJam. The theme of the jam was "Out Of Control". My interpretation of this theme builds around the concept of marking enemies for multiplication. Once you marked an enemy, it can't be unmarked. Every marked enemy will multiply itself, where the rate and speed is depending on the specific type of enemy. This means things can quickly get "out of control" ;)

Early development didn't go as planned
